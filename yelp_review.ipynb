       "xxbos xxmaj hi all . xxmaj wanted to give a 6 month update - pros and con 's and some good tips . i apologize to folks that sent me messages directly , i did n't realize how yelp messages worked . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj first off , getting electrical construction stuff done to your house is very difficult . xxmaj there are lots of permits and approvals required . xxmaj be prepared for a lengthy process of getting plans approved , work scheduled , inspections scheduled and approved etc . xxmaj it took a while for ours to get done , but it was worth the wait . xxmaj our roof has flat cement tiles - easier to walk on and install stuff on , i 'm not aware of any damaged tiles , but if your roof has those beautiful curved tiles , i would expect a harder install process as one reviewer can attest . i think that xxmaj solar xxmaj city should send their \" crack \" team of repair dudes to that guys house to make it right and post new pictures of nice matching tiles . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj pro 's : xxmaj the panels are installed and working like they should . xxmaj we are satisfied with their performance and we are seeing cost savings every month . i ca n't tell how much because we were on the monthly average plan , so we still have a positive balance with xxup srp . xxmaj our monthly balanced payment amount was 225 - 240 per month year round . xxmaj we are paying less than that every month with the summer rapidly approaching . \n",
       "  i contacted xxmaj solar xxmaj city a few times and got good service every time . xxmaj once to ask about the \" flip the switch \" to activate the panels ( i thought i was supposed to do that but there was one final inspection by xxup srp and xxmaj solar xxmaj city remaining - they came out , did the inspection and they flipped the switch ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj another time was to express my indignation about a 15 dollar surcharge added to my bill because i did not allow them to withdraw directly from my bank account . i had set up an automatic bill pay yet that was n't the same thing to them . xxmaj the 15 dollar surcharge is in the contract , so while i was unhappy about it , i did sign the contract . i found a solution . i have multiple bank accounts ( due to relocating to xxmaj phoenix ) and one is my active account and the other has a small savings and check balance to remain active . xxmaj now i send a \" payment \" to my secondary account and let them take their money from the secondary account . xxmaj they get their money , i save 15 dollars and my main checking account is isolated from \" auto debit \" robots . \n",
       "  xxmaj you are helping reduce the load on the grid during peak times ! xxmaj this helps avoid xxunk xxunk because of too much demand and not enough coming from the power plants . xxup srp will have to shut down one of their big coal plants soon ( thanks xxup epa ) and that means more stress on their grid . xxmaj anything to reduce that stress is a good thing , and we are going green to boot ... \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj con 's : xxmaj you have installers up on your roof putting stuff up there . xxmaj not every install team is comprised of anal - retentive engineers , so be prepared for the possibility of a bit of stuff left laying around ( there is a water bottle that fell onto a lower level that is still there , a couple pieces of scrap that fell from the roof etc ) . xxmaj nothing that was worthy of a complaint call , but just know that construction is messy . \n",
       "  i 'm not seeing evidence that xxup srp is \" buying \" our excess electricity , they install these new electronic meters , so you ca n't see the wheel spinning backwards and the numbers count in reverse or anything like that . xxmaj our typical bill from xxup srp has a solar connection fee of about 17 bucks , and a small balance of electricity that we purchase , so maybe there is some magical process that happens . \n",
       "  xxmaj it will take some time from the day that you sign the agreement to when they go live . xxmaj ours went pretty quickly and it was still around 2 - 3 months from signed deal to generating electricity . a friend 's took more like 6 months , but they are generating electricity now too . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj tip : xxmaj remember that you signed an agreement to buy the electricity from your panels - use it ! xxmaj it took us a while to get into the mode of running stuff during the daylight hours ( dishwasher , laundry , pool pump , and we keep the xxup ac about 4 - 5 degrees cooler during the day now ) . xxmaj even doing all that stuff during a sunny day , we generate more than we use ( but just barely ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj solar xxmaj city has met every obligation , treated us with respect , and even sent us a referral check as they advertised . xxmaj read the contract , understand what you are agreeing to and call them if you have questions - they are decent folks . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj first off , getting electrical construction stuff done to your house is very difficult . xxmaj there are lots of permits and approvals required . xxmaj be prepared for a lengthy process of getting plans approved , work scheduled , inspections scheduled and approved etc . xxmaj it took a while for ours to get done , but it was worth the wait . xxmaj our roof has flat cement tiles - easier to walk on and install stuff on , i 'm not aware of any damaged tiles , but if your roof has those beautiful curved tiles , i would expect a harder install process as one reviewer can attest . i think that xxmaj solar xxmaj city should send their \" crack \" team of repair dudes to that guys house to make it right and post new pictures of nice matching tiles . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj pro 's : xxmaj the panels are installed and working like they should . xxmaj we are satisfied with their performance and we are seeing cost savings every month . i ca n't tell how much because we were on the monthly average plan , so we still have a positive balance with xxup srp . xxmaj our monthly balanced payment amount was 225 - 240 per month year round . xxmaj we are paying less than that every month with the summer rapidly approaching . \n",
       "  i contacted xxmaj solar xxmaj city a few times and got good service every time . xxmaj once to ask about the \" flip the switch \" to activate the panels ( i thought i was supposed to do that but there was one final inspection by xxup srp and xxmaj solar xxmaj city remaining - they came out , did the inspection and they flipped the switch ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj another time was to express my indignation about a 15 dollar surcharge added to my bill because i did not allow them to withdraw directly from my bank account . i had set up an automatic bill pay yet that was n't the same thing to them . xxmaj the 15 dollar surcharge is in the contract , so while i was unhappy about it , i did sign the contract . i found a solution . i have multiple bank accounts ( due to relocating to xxmaj phoenix ) and one is my active account and the other has a small savings and check balance to remain active . xxmaj now i send a \" payment \" to my secondary account and let them take their money from the secondary account . xxmaj they get their money , i save 15 dollars and my main checking account is isolated from \" auto debit \" robots . \n",
       "  xxmaj you are helping reduce the load on the grid during peak times ! xxmaj this helps avoid xxunk xxunk because of too much demand and not enough coming from the power plants . xxup srp will have to shut down one of their big coal plants soon ( thanks xxup epa ) and that means more stress on their grid . xxmaj anything to reduce that stress is a good thing , and we are going green to boot ... \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj con 's : xxmaj you have installers up on your roof putting stuff up there . xxmaj not every install team is comprised of anal - retentive engineers , so be prepared for the possibility of a bit of stuff left laying around ( there is a water bottle that fell onto a lower level that is still there , a couple pieces of scrap that fell from the roof etc ) . xxmaj nothing that was worthy of a complaint call , but just know that construction is messy . \n",
       "  i 'm not seeing evidence that xxup srp is \" buying \" our excess electricity , they install these new electronic meters , so you ca n't see the wheel spinning backwards and the numbers count in reverse or anything like that . xxmaj our typical bill from xxup srp has a solar connection fee of about 17 bucks , and a small balance of electricity that we purchase , so maybe there is some magical process that happens . \n",
       "  xxmaj it will take some time from the day that you sign the agreement to when they go live . xxmaj ours went pretty quickly and it was still around 2 - 3 months from signed deal to generating electricity . a friend 's took more like 6 months , but they are generating electricity now too . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj tip : xxmaj remember that you signed an agreement to buy the electricity from your panels - use it ! xxmaj it took us a while to get into the mode of running stuff during the daylight hours ( dishwasher , laundry , pool pump , and we keep the xxup ac about 4 - 5 degrees cooler during the day now ) . xxmaj even doing all that stuff during a sunny day , we generate more than we use ( but just barely ) . \n",

       "  i ordered the xxmaj salmon xxmaj skin hand roll and it was the worst i had ever tasted in my life , the xxmaj salmon xxmaj skin was pieces of skin about 4 - xxunk long sticking out of the hand roll , not 1 or 2 pieces but what appeared to be the whole damn salmon , it was truly overkill . xxmaj when i xxunk into the xxmaj salmon xxmaj skin hand roll , there was such a load crunch i believe people were looking around to see if metal was xxunk from a car accident outside . xxmaj it was awful , i felt like i was eating a pork rind hand roll , it was way to crunchy and just too much of it . i then ordered the xxup xxunk xxmaj roll thinking , not too complicated , it 's a roll with only three little letters for a name , so i thought to myself , as long as there was n't any more of that dreadful eel in the roll , maybe this roll will be a winner . xxmaj who knew , how do you screw up a roll that has xxmaj tuna , xxmaj salmon , xxmaj cream xxmaj cheese and xxmaj avocado ; simple , cut the pieces so big you need someone without just in case you need someone to perform the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj maneuver on you when you choke . xxmaj only 6 piece came out where there should have been 8 and possible 10 for a cut roll , the pieces were just too thick to be enjoyable , nobody wants that much cream cheese in their mouth at one time , unless you 're sitting down to put the hurt on a lox bagel . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj sushi is about freshness , textures , flavors , combinations of flavors and the perfect balance of vinegar rice to raw fish . xxmaj if any of these are not correct , it ruins the entire sushi experience . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj xxunk xxmaj sushi reminds me of amateur hour at the xxmaj laugh xxmaj factory , although they did get a laugh out of me , as i said when i opened , what a xxmaj joke . i could n't believe i was actually paying money for this crap , just about anyone could read a book at home and learn how to cut , prepare and assemble better tasting sushi than xxmaj xxunk sushi . xxmaj do n't waste your time and money going here , there 's just not enough customers for the fish to be fresh , hence the xxmaj unagi in a can , slimy xxmaj surf xxmaj clam and already chewed xxmaj albacore .,xxbos xxmaj buckle your asses up boys and girls . xxmaj here is one of the few honest and unprompted reviews you 'll find on this page . xxmaj sit down and join me will you ? \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj now , there are a few consistencies i tend to see on xxmaj yelp : \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the wedding industry averages 5 stars \n",
       "  xxmaj restaurants get the gambit \n",
       "  xxmaj apartment complexes get absolutely xxunk . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj why do apartments get the shaft ? xxmaj people only go on their apartment 's xxmaj yelp page when they 're pissed off . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj as i sit here in my last day , i 'll hit you with my pros and cons and explain why this place ended with 5 stars . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj might as well start with the cons : \n",
       " \n",
       "  -the garage gates are literally always broken . xxmaj at least 1 out of the 4 entry / xxunk is always permanently up or permanently down . xxmaj the moment they fix one , another immediately decides to break . xxmaj it 's honestly impressive how much it happens . \n",
       "  xxunk off the first one , my bike got stolen from the garage and nothing could be done . \n",
       "  -it 's a bit of a crapshoot on noise . xxmaj occasionally you get that asshat peeling out down the street or talking loudly . xxmaj but honestly it was n't that bothersome . xxmaj it 's nothing compared to the places in old town or xxmaj tempe . \n",
       "  -it 's a bit pricy i guess ? i 've seen people complain about it but i think it 's xxup well worth the money . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj this brings me to the pros ! \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxunk balls this place is nice . xxmaj all the units are decked the hell out . kitchen is fantastic , washer / dryer in every until , storage , etc . i lived on the third floor , kept my place tidy , and literally only ever had one bug ( a fly ) in my place and that 's cause i left the door open . \n",
       "  -the parking garage is indoors ( go figure ) . xxmaj compared to pretty much everywhere else that has outdoor parking , this is a fucking xxup dream . xxmaj arizona summers can suck it . xxmaj also , the gate issue is more of an inconvenience than anything . \n",
       "  -the front office staff are the fucking best ! xxmaj here 's looking at you , xxmaj brenda ! xxmaj they all learn your names and do what they can to help . xxmaj one morning , my xxup ac went out and it was fixed by the time i got home . xxmaj every little thing is handled super efficiently by maintenance . xxmaj also , there are a bunch of tvs in the lobby , during xxup nfl season , they realized a bunch of us congregated down there and the next weekend had the xxunk package purchased . \n",
       "  -the location - $ 7 lyft ride to xxmaj old town or xxmaj mill . xxmaj ca n't beat that . xxmaj plus you 're peeing distance from 3 great bars and a xxmaj dutch xxmaj bros. \n",
       "  -the coffee machine . xxmaj holy fucking hell that machine pretty much paid for my rent every month . xxmaj it has options for days . xxmaj saved me an insane amount of money on caffeine . \n",
       "  -the pool . xxmaj it 's quite nice . i love the ambiance out there . xxmaj they recently locked down on poolside shenanigans . xxmaj you ca n't throw a wager down there . xxmaj that being said , if you have music on and it 's not obnoxious and you keep your beer discreet , then you can have a nice xxmaj saturday down there . xxmaj just be cool . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj anyway there it is . xxmaj live here . xxmaj it 's great . i gave it 5 stars because even with the small issues , it 's so much better than anywhere i 've ever lived \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj protip - all large apartment rent structures are built on an algorithm . xxmaj that takes into account supply and demand . xxmaj if you have a bit of time , it 's worth it to check day after day to see what the current price is .\n",
