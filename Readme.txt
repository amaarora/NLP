In this project, I have used fast.ai NLP wrapper around PyTorch to create a language model that predicts the next words of an Arthur Conan Doyle novel series. 
I have used the top 15 books by Arthur Conan Doyle as available on Project Gutenberg. 
Future work involves further using the model for sentimental analysis.
